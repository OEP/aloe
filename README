aloe (All Logged Out Event) is a command-line utility which runs a command
after everyone has logged out of the system.  It is written for Linux but
should work for other mostly POSIX-compliant systems.

Some common use cases are:

Reboot the system after everyone has logged out:
# aloe reboot

Restart the X11 display manager after all graphical sessions have ended:
# aloe -t :* service gdm restart

Modify a user's home directory after they have logged out:
# aloe -u <username> <some program>

aloe works by monitoring the utmpx database, which, on most systems, is a
discretionary database of who is logged in, but in practice it is reliable
enough for aloe to use.

By default, aloe runs in the background. Any output from the program is
ignored, unless aloe is run in the foreground using the -f flag.
